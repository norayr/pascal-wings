# pascal wings
## pascal wrapper to wings windowmaker library

## requirements

On Gentoo, WINGs headers are installed by windowmaker ebuild.

On Debian-ish systems:

```
apt-get install libwings-dev
```

if you want to use a wrapper for freepascal, it is assumed you have freepascal. (:

## build

```
make
```
